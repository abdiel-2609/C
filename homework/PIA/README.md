# Final Project

## Snake
This program is a recreation of the famous game “snake”.

## Plan Project

The plan that is had for this project is that this one can be played of the way most similar to the original game, being the playground a matrix of [x][y], where the serpent can move in the x-axis and y-axis without greater problem.
