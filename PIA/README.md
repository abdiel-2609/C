# Final Project

## Snake
This program is a recreation of the famous game “snake”.

## Objective 
The objective of the project is to match snake and that has an operation similar to the game which we know.

## How to compile it?
In order to be able to compile the game, we needed 3 files; main.c, snake.h and funciones.c 
I would recommend to use the Code::Blocks compiler, but also she works well with GDB online.

## How to play?
We must go to us moving within the playground to eat the fruit without touching the edges.
The controls of snake are: 
W: Up
A: Left 
S: Down 
D: Right
To move, we will have to be pressing the key enter.
