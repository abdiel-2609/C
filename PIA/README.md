## Objective 
The objective of the project is to match snake and that has an operation similar to the game which we know.

## How to compile it?
In order to be able to compile the game, we needed 3 files; main.c, snake.h and funciones.c. 
I would recommend to use the Code::Blocks compiler, but also it works well with GDB online.

## How to play?
We must go to us moving within the playground to eat the fruit without touching the edges.
The controls of snake are: 
* W: Up
* A: Left 
* S: Down 
* D: Right

To move, we will have to be pressing the key enter.

## Self-assessment
1: complexity 2 (I think the program was a bit complicated, but not that much)

2: functionality 3 (on very few occasions the program stops working well)

3: code 3 (I think I made a clean code)

4: storage 1 (I only used the data structures)

5: documentation 1 (I believe that I had several orthographic errors, aside  the video is not very good)
